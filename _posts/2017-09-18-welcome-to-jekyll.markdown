description: "Migrated my Jekyll site from GitHub Pages to Netlify."

---
Greetings,

this is my first post on my new site. I recently moved www.joit.co.uk to GitHub pages from a shared hosting provider.
This was mainly due to that it was hard to justify the high renewal cost as I mostly use this domain for
my emails (Provided by Google Apps) and some blog posts.

This site was previously run as a WordPress site and I took the opportunity to try setting up a static website
backed by Jekyll. After a few days running as a GitHub pages site, I heard of www.netlify.com and after reading about
their service, I decided to try and migrate to Netlify. Netlify offers a few perks compared to GitHub Pages, mainly...
- HTTPS on custom domain using Letsencrypt
- HTTP/2 connections
- Continous deployments
